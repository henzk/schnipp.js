Testing schnipp.js
====================

schnipp.js uses karma for running unit tests. Karma is based on node.js.

Installation
-------------------

Install node.js
'''''''''''''''''''''''

If node.js is not already installed, please do so first.
On Linux, it is recommended to use NVM::

    wget -qO- https://raw.github.com/creationix/nvm/master/install.sh | sh

(This creates ~/.nvm and adds a line to your profile. See https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

::
    . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
    nvm install v.0.11.2
    nvm alias default v0.11.2


Install Karma
''''''''''''''''''''''

::
    npm install -g karma
    npm install -g istanbul #test coverage tool

Running the tests
-------------------

::
    cd /path/to/schnipp.js/test
    karma start karma.conf.js

As soon as karma has started, connect at least one browser by visiting http://localhost:9876/

If for some reason the ``karma`` command is not available, try::

    . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
