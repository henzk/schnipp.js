Testing schnipp.js
====================

schnipp.js uses karma for running unit tests. Karma is based on node.js.

Installation
-------------------

Install node.js
'''''''''''''''''''''''

If node.js is not already installed, please do so first.
On Linux, it is recommended to use NVM::

    wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.10.0/install.sh | bash

(This creates ~/.nvm and adds a line to your profile. See https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

::
    
    nvm install is failing so installing 0.10 manually
    cd ~/.nvm
    wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.10.29/node-v0.10.29-linux-x64.tar.gz ~/.nvm
    tar xfvz node-v0.10.29-linux-x64.tar.gz
    mv node-v0.10.29-linux-x64 v0.10.29
    nvm use 0.10
    nvm alias default v0.10


Install Karma
''''''''''''''''''''''

::
    npm install -g karma
    npm install -g istanbul #test coverage tool
    npm install -g phantomjs #headless browser

Running the tests
-------------------

::
    cd /path/to/schnipp.js/test
    karma start karma.conf.js

As soon as karma has started, connect at least one browser by visiting http://localhost:9876/

If for some reason the ``karma`` command is not available, try::

    . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh


Also, have a look at the Makefile, which provides some shortcuts:

    make test

runs all tests and exits


    make apidocs

generate api documentation


    make tdd

runs tests and builds documentation in a loop; listens for file changes. This command will open up 2 eterm windows.
